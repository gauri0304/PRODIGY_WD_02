Stopwatch
web Application

To build a stopwatch web application,
you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
HTML is used to structure the elements
of the application. By implementing
functions for starting, pausing, and
resetting the stopwatch, as well as
tracking and displaying lap times, users
can accurately measure and record time
intervals. With these technologies and
functionalities, you can create an
interactive and user-friendly stopwatch
web application.
